Last week finally we got the opportunity to visit Dinant, which is a small town known for its natural beauty and some terrible historic events that happened there during late 1800s. Another relatively lesser know fact about this place is that Adolphe Sax, inventor of the saxophone was also born and brought up in the vicinity of Citadel fort, which is a prominent  tourist attraction in this region of Belgium.

It was a day trip. We left Brussels at around 10 AM and reached Dinant within an hour. Weather was very nice and sunny on that day. We started our tour by clicking some snaps of Citadel fort which was just about 400 meters from the station. Then we took a cable car tide to the top of the fort and spent a few hours there on the hill. Ranit had some great time on the swings in the play area for kids while we enjoyed the guided tour of the citadel fort. After getting down from Citadel we went to see the house of Adolphe Sax which still displays some of the original Saxophones that he made. We felt privileged for having got an opportunity to get some snaps clicked with the statue of Adolphe Sax.

I bought some beers and snacks from a grocery store and then spent some time on the river side while enjoying the Beer and Sandwiches that Rajni had prepared and brought from home. 

It was overall a relaxed tour where we didn't sweat ourselves too much and enjoyed it on a slow pace without having to run from one site to the other. 

There are a few other scenic places, ch√¢teaus and a small beautiful village in that area, that we have saved for our next trip :-).
